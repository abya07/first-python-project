1. Define a dataframe named 'Bank_df_1' that contains the first and last names for 5 bank clients with IDs = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Assume that the bank got 5 new clients, define another dataframe named 'Bank_df_2' that contains a new clients with IDs = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
3. Let's assume we obtained additional information (Annual Salary) about all our bank customers (10 customers)
4. Concatenate both 'bank_df_1' and 'bank_df_2' dataframes
5. Merge client names and their newly added salary information using the 'Bank Client ID'
6. Let's assume that you became a new client to the bank
7. Define a new DataFrame that contains your information such as client ID (choose 11), first name, last name, and annual salary.
